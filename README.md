# Introduction to Linux/UNIX and the Bash shell - UNIL CAS in data stewardship

Welcome to the home page of the **Introduction to Linux/UNIX and the Bash shell**
course of the **University of Lausanne CAS in data stewardship**.

This one-day course provides an introduction to the open source
**[Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux)** /

### Setting-up your environment

The only technical requirement for the course is having a laptop with a
reasonably recent version of either a `bash` shell (version >= `4.0`), or a
`zsh` shell (the default shell on Mac OS since 2019).
You can display your version of `bash` with the command `bash --version`.
